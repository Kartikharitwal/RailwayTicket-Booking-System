Panjim, the capital city located in the centre is well-connected with an international airport and roads and trains run from North to South part of Goa.</p>

                       <p> With a coastline stretching for over 100 kilometres, Goa has numerous beaches that attract millions of visitors. While Baga and Calangute are more popular among the Indian family crowd, Anjuna and Arambol draw a lot of foreign tourists. The beaches in South Goa are relatively lesser explored, but some of them like Agonda and Palolem are more beautiful.</p>

                       <p> A former Portuguese colony, Goa also boasts of beautiful architecture from the colonial era with many churches and old-style bungalows. The people are quite friendly towards tourists and celebrate many festivals throughout the year. While the seafood is excellent, Goa has one of the best nightlife in the country with trendy bars, beach shacks, elegant cafes and many clubs and discotheques. Thanks to lower alcohol prices in the state, Goa is also great for younger tourists with relatively tighter pockets.</p>

                    <p>Udaipur, also known as the City of Lakes, is the crown jewel of the state of Rajasthan. It is surrounded by the beautiful Aravalli Hills in all directions, making this city as lovely as it is.

                <div class="modal-body">
                     <p>World's oldest living city, Varanasi enchants and surprises its visitors in the same breath. Also known as Kashi (City of Life) and Benaras, this spiritual capital of India is one of Hinduism's seven holy cities. The old city of Varanasi sits along the western banks of the Ganges, spread across a labyrinth of alleys called galis which are too narrow for the traffic to pass through - be prepared to walk on foot and encounter some holy cows! There are temples at almost every turn in Varanasi, but the Kashi Vishwanath Temple is the most visited and the oldest of the lot (Benaras is known as the city of Lord Shiva for a reason, and rightfully so).</p>

                    <p>Varanasi is considered an auspicious place to die, as it is believed to grant moksha or liberation from the cycle of life and death. Spiritually enlightening and spectacularly photogenic, the heart of the city pulsates around the ghats, about 80 of which border the Ganges - be prepared for the sights, sounds and smells! All chaos and noise on the ghats take a pause when the Ganga Aarti takes place after dusk, a ceremony of immense grandeur. This divine city is also an important destination for Buddhists. Gautam Buddha preached his modal7 sermon in Banaras, a part which is now in Sarnath. Typical of any Indian city, the food here is a delicious repertoire of dishes - don't miss out on the hot chaat and cool lassi.</p>

                    <p>The journey through Banaras will blaze in your memory, long after you've left its shore! Varanasi is India in all her glory, as it has been for thousands of years, and as it will be for a thousand more.</p>

                    <p>Having evolved gradually from being the Garden city to the Silicon Valley of India, Bangalore is India's third-largest city. Bangalore is loved for its pleasant weather, beautiful parks and lakes all around the town.</p>

                    <p>When in Bangalore, one can choose to take a long, stroll through the greenery of Cubbon Park, shop in many modern malls or street side markets or hop into one of the several acclaimed craft breweries in the city for a cold and refreshing drink. Bangalore had come to be renowned for its eateries, street food corners, quirky cafes, coffee roasters and pubs dotting every corner of the city, serving cuisines from all over the world. Brunches, buffets, burgers, rooftop cafes, late-night eats - Bangalore has it all.</p>

                    <p>However, the unprecedented growth of IT in Bangalore has reshaped quite a few things including rising temperatures, polluted lakes and heavily congested roads, especially in the newer areas.</p>

                    <p>Aside from the central business and commercial districts (and the roads leading up to them), the neighbourhoods of Bangalore are mostly quiet and serene, especially the older parts of the city. There's still the early-morning cacophony of street vendors ambling down the streets with carts, selling fresh fruits and vegetables. There are a huge number of beautifully decorated parks in the city that are ideal for going on a morning stroll or a jog. One walk through the 300-acre Cubbon Park, or the botanical gardens of Lalbagh, and you'll know precisely why Bangalore is so famously called India's 'Garden City'.</p>
